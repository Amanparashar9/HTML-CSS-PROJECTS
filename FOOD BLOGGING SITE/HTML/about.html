                &diams; Delhi, the iconic post-colonial capital of India, represents a food utopia, an epicurean paradise of sorts, with cuisines for just about every palate. Whether it is Mughlai splendors, street food discoveries, or global foods with an Indian twist,
                Delhi is the place to be. Each street and lane of Delhi is imbued with a history of gastronomic glory, offering the flavors of heritage, tradition and a passion for food that has been shaped over eras, across borders, and in the hearts
                of the city's people. Delhi Food Walks began in 2011 to act as a bastion of Delhi food culture. Initially, we organized walks for tourists who could get a slice of true Delhi cuisines through our food walks. Gradually, we expanded the
                network and honed our expertise, opening our walks to students and corporate groups as well. Delhi Food Walks now beckons food aficionados from diverse backgrounds; if you have an appetite, we are here to satiate it. Delhi Food Walks is
                the original culinary tourism company of Delhi. Aside from taking you to the nooks and crannies which are home to the most delicious aromas in Delhi, we also curate Food Festivals in Delhi. Our events are usually a celebration of the myriad
                of cultures and lifestyles. We like to create opportunities for our patrons to connect to vendors that have created legacies or are making history in the culinary world from their own sweet corner. We also run a Youtube channel with the
                name 'Delhi Food Walks' where we bring you the vibrancy of Street Food from all across India. We have an exclusive portfolio with major brands like the ITC Ltd. , Baskin Robbins India, Rekhta Foundation etc. and we also take up Personal
                Projects to bring recognition to the unsung extraordinary chefs in the streets of Delhi with the first ever 'Street Food Awards'. And the good news is that our team is branching out with 'India Culinary Tours' with which we will be able
                to reach out to all the food lovers across India. The new website www.indiaculinarytours.com will be live soon.
            </p>

                &diams; Delhi Street Food Indian Street Food In Delhi Different people have different feelings about street food. Some people don't like eating out in open, mostly standing and surrounded by other folks. Others have misgivings about cleanliness and hygiene.
                Valid points but it's also true that flavors and innovation offered by street food vendors are hard to replicate in fancy, expensive restaurants. Street food is cheap and usually very delicious. Most vendors worth their salt have better
                standards than many branded food joints. You can see the food being prepared and cooking conditions with your own eyes. It’s unlike most established restaurants. In most cases, the cooking recipe is in the vendors family for generations
                and is zealously guarded just the way MNCs like Coca-Cola, KFC etc. guard their own recipes.

                Gappe, Aaloo Tikki, Chole Bhatoore, Dahi Bhalle, Poori Kachori, Chaat, Pakode, Samosa, Bhel poori and many many more. Momos (dumplings) along with some other Chinese food like Chowmein cooked in a unique Indian style has gained some popularity
